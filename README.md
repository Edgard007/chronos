## Description

[React](https://github.com/facebook/react) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Configuration

Below, we outline the configuration of your project:

### Path Aliases

Aliases for simplifying folder paths in your project have been configured. You can find them in the `tsconfig.json` file.

```js
baseUrl: '.',
paths: {
   "@src/*": ["src/*"],
   "@assets/*": ["src/common/assets/*"],
   "@common/*": ["src/common/*"],
   "@components/*": ["src/components/*"],
   "@config/*": ["src/config/*"],
   "@helpers/*": ["src/helpers/*"],
   "@hooks/*": ["src/hooks/*"],
   "@pages/*": ["src/pages/*"],
   "@utils/*": ["src/utils/*"],
   "@actions/*": ["src/utils/actions/*"],
   "@contexts/*": ["src/utils/contexts/*"],
   "@interfaces/*": ["src/utils/interfaces/*"],
   "@providers/*": ["src/utils/providers/*"],
   "@reducers/*": ["src/utils/reducers/*"],
   "@types/*": ["src/utils/types/*"]
},
```

### Language

Internationalization (i18n) is set up for the following languages:

- Spanish.
- English.

### Styles

#### Themes

Project supports two themes:

- Dark mode.
- Light mode.

#### Global Variables

In the `styles` directory, you'll find files defining global variables for:

- Colors.
- Fonts.
- Animations.
- Sizes, z-index, etc.

### Layout

Project includes a layout with:

- Navbar.
- Main.

### Reducer

A Reducer has been configured using `useContext` and `useReducer` to store language and theme settings. Additionally, the following features have been implemented:

- Device information retrieval (theme, language).
- Data persistence in local storage.

## Installation

Chronos requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20+ to run.

For this project, I recommend using [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) instead of NPM to install the dependencies. PNPM offers several advantages, including:

- Speed: PNPM is significantly faster than NPM, especially when installing projects with many dependencies.
- Space efficiency: PNPM stores dependencies efficiently, using a hashed tree file system and avoiding duplicate files.
- Integrity: PNPM checks the integrity of dependencies to ensure that they are not corrupted or altered.
- Ease of use: PNPM is compatible with most NPM commands and workflows, making the transition easy.

```sh
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://<URL_REPOSITORY>
```

```sh
# Navigate to project folder
$ cd [project-name]
```

```sh
# Install dependencies
$ pnpm i
```

This command will download and install all the dependencies listed in your project's `package.json` file.

## Enviroment config

> Clone `.env.template` file and rename copy to `.env`; and fill in the variables.

## Running app

```sh
# Start app
$ pnpm start
```

## Running test

```sh
# Start test
$ pnpm test
```

## Dependencies

```js
dependencies: {
    "react",
    "react-dom",
    "@azure/msal-browser",
    "@azure/msal-react",
    "butterup-toast",
    "i18next",
    "i18next-http-backend",
    "react-i18next",
    "react-router-dom",
